# ToDo Application

>Full Stack Todo Application

## General Info

Project was created with React, Node/Express and MySQL. Created app to have a single source of truth in the database, all user interactions kick off an HTTP request to the server to update a record in the database. So all user actions are persisted before the UI is updated.

Each user is tracked in the user table, only the current users tasks are visible. Todos can be sorted by completed, incomplete or all todos oldest to newest. This project was part of creating an MVP, minimum viable product, in a short time period.

### Tables and API Routes
